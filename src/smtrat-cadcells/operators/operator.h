 * Projection operators.
 * 
 * Currently, only the McCallum based operator is implemented.
 * 
 * ## Relevant projection functions
 * 
 * We refer to @ref algorithms for usage examples.
 * 
 * ### Cells
 * - project_basic_properties
 * - delineate_properties
 * - project_cell_properties
 * 
 * ### Coverings
 * 
 * - project_basic_properties (on each cell individually)
 * - delineate_properties (on each cell individually)
 * - project_covering_properties
 * 
 * ### Delineation
 * 
 * - project_basic_properties
 * - delineate_properties
 * - project_delineation_properties
